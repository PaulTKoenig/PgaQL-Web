	Statistical Approach to Predicting NCAAB Outcomes
</div>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold py-5">
	Developed logistic regression model that predicts the outcome of basketball games at a ~97% accuracy given the final box score and derived advanced stats from NCAA College basketball games.
</div>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold py-5">
	Developed two team ranking systems based off scoring and overall efficiency, data preprocessing transformation algorithm that significantly reduced model overfitting, and future matchup box score prediction to ~30% accuracy.
</div>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold py-5">
	When put together, achieved ~73% accuracy in producing the correct outcome of games only using statistics provided before the game.
</div>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold py-5">
	Outperformed all similar models found with publicly available prediction accuracies including the TeamRanking.com Decision Tree Model (71.2%), a website that is described as "the web's #1 source for algorithmic sports predictions and data".
