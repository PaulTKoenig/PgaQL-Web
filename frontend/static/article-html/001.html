	MLExpress is a project that roots from a business competition at The Ohio State University. The goal was to develop a solution to any problem, not specifically a technology issue, and present the project as if it were shark tank. Throughout the competition, we were paired with mentors to teach us the steps of bringing a business to life, attended weekly meetings to learn about the competition, and heard from previous participants and local business gurus. Unfortunately, I had to drop out of the competition due to a clause in my work contract that states they own all of my intellectual property, I learned a ton and had a lot of fun building this project.

	Our solution was an educational website that allows a user to preprocess and train predictive machine learning models without a line of code. The interface would visually show what is happening to the data, teach users best practices, and include courses on how/why each step works. The models would train locally on a computer with tensorflow.js or on a cloud service if the user wanted to train larger models. This would work well with a platform like kaggle where users could attain data sets from kaggle and train it on our website.

	I built a fully functional prototype in react that was able to take a data set, preprocess it, and train it on 2 different types of models to compare the results.

	Example of using the app:

	Upload a csv or xls file
	View the dataset and summary of each feature
	view distributions for each feature
	remove any outliers
	scale or transform any features
	select what features are the outcome(s) and what to train
	train models and update hyperparameters as needed
