	MLExpress is a project that was started in a business acceleration competition at The Ohio State University. Throughout the competition, we were paired with mentors to teach us the steps of bringing a business to life, attended weekly meetings to learn about the competition, and heard from previous participants and local business gurus. Unfortunately, I had to drop out of the competition due to a clause in my work contract that states they own all of my intellectual property, I learned a ton and had a lot of fun building this project.

	Our solution was an educational data analytics and visualization platform that allows users to prepare, blend, and analyze data without requiring extensive coding knowledge. The models would train on the user's browser with tensorflow.js or on a cloud service for larger models. We would like to pair this with a platform such as kaggle to attain data sets, train on our platform, and compare results with other users leveraging competitions to increase user-engagement.

	I built a fully functional prototype in react that was able to take a data set, preprocess it, and train it on 2 different types of models to compare the results.

	Example of using the app:

	Upload a csv or xls file
	View the dataset and summary of each feature
	view distributions for each feature
	remove any outliers
	scale or transform any features
	select what features are the outcome(s) and what to train
	train models and update hyperparameters as needed
